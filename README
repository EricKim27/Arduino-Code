This is a repository for storing my arduino codes that I've used for my school's experiments. 
The codes uploaded here are mostly codes that utilizes Photo Interrupters.

sketch_dec05a - This code requires two Photo Interrupters. It calculates the gravitational acceleration.

sketch_jan05a - This prints the data read from the Photo Interrupter.
